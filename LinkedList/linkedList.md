# Linked List 🔗

## What's a Linked List? 🤔
- A **linked list** is a chain of **nodes**. Each node has **data** and a link to the **next node**.
- It's like a treasure hunt, where each clue leads to the next. 🗺️💎

## Pros & Cons 🎭
- **Pros**:
    - Flexible size 📏
    - Easy to add/remove nodes ➕➖
- **Cons**:
    - More memory (each node needs extra space for the link) 🧠
    - Sequential access (start to finish) 🚶‍♂️

## Key Ops 🔑
1. **Insertion**: Add a new node 🆕
2. **Deletion**: Remove a node 🗑️
3. **Traversal**: Visit each node in sequence 🔍
